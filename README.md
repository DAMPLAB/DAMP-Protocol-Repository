## About
This GitHub repository is a protocol repository containing the necessary libraries and protocols for all DAMP-Aquarium Workflows as of 3/22/2022.

Workflows can be shared among the Aquarium community. A workflow consists of a set of Operation Types, Protocols, Code Libraries, Sample Type definitions, and Container definitions. Workflows are stored in files ending with .aq.
